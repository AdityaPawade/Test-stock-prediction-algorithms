# StockPredictions
Use classic tricks, neural networks, deep learning, genetic programming and other methods to predict stock and market movements.

Both successful and unsuccessful experiments will be posted. This section is things that are currently being explored. Completed projects will be wrapped up and moved to another repository to keep things simple.
