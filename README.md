# StockPredictions
Use classic tricks, neural networks, deep learning, genetic programming and other methods to predict stock and market movements.

Both successful and unsuccessful experiments will be posted. This section is things that are currently being explored. Completed projects will be wrapped up and moved to another repository to keep things simple.

<b>Completed:</b>

Book value vs rumor vs PE buying, which is better?

Does trailing vs future PE tell anything useful?

Try predicting future prices using regression on several length MA and combine them

Predict tipping points more accurately

Predict future values (3, 6, 9, 12 months) based on current information
