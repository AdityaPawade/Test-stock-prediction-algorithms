# StockPredictions
Use classic tricks, neural networks, deep learning, genetic programming and other methods to predict stock and market movements.

Both successful and unsuccessful experiments will be posted. This section is things that are currently being explored. Completed projects will be wrapped up and moved to another repository to keep things simple.


<b>Data and the cleaning programs:</b>

<b>Data sources:</b>

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/



<b>Completed and spun off in another repository:</b>

https://github.com/timestocome/StockMarketMovingAverage  Moving average buy/sell under/over vs buy and hold 


<b>Completed but not useful:</b> if it was this easy all statisticians would be rich. Still it's worth going through because sometimes faint signals can be found and combined with other faint signals to give useful information.

https://github.com/timestocome/StockMarketLinearRegression  Experiments in various regression techniques 


<b>Looks promising enough to test on financial data:</b>

https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-with-tensorflow Meap Machine Learning with TensorFlow, excellent TensorFlow reference, not a good reference if you're looking to learn Machine Learning, I'm on my second pass, reworking all the example code with stock data, the stuff that shows promise is being loaded up here. I'll go deeper into all of them as time allows
